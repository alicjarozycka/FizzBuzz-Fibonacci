## General info

This project was created using python 3.10.4 version. It contains two scripts:

-   FizzBuzz
-   Fibonacci

## How to run

### To run FizzBuzz, you have to be in the project root directory and in the terminal write:

```
$ python FizzBuzz.py
```

We are asked to give two numbers, it is a range, for each number in that range we print:

-   Fizz (if divisible by 3),
-   Buzz (if divisible by 5),
-   FizzBuzz (if divisible by 5 and 3)
-   number(other cases).

In that case first number should be greater or equal 1 and less than the second one.
Second number should be greater than the first one and less or equal to 10000.

### To run Fibonacci, in the project root directory write in the terminal:

```
$ python Fibonacci.py
```

We are asked to give two numbers which are a range, to get Fibonacci sequence. It is a set of integers that starts with 0 and is followed by a one. Then by another one and then by a series of steadily increasing numbers. Each number is equal to the sum of preceding two numbers.
In that case first number should be greater or equal to 1 and less than the second one.
Second number should be greater than the first one and less than or equal to 250.

### To run all tests we should also be in the project root directory and in the terminal write:

```
$ python -m unittest -v
```
